# IndieBlade
**Gravity hack for indie games on Unity**

## Description

IndieBlade is an application that allows you to change the gravity value in games using the memory injection method. The user enters the game's process name and can specify a new gravity value if they know the current value.

## Note
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <strong>The program may not support all games, but it tends to work effectively with indie games built on the Unity platform.

This program is designed for x64 games. If you want to make it compatible with x86 games, please download [Memory Raider x86](https://github.com/capital0v/MemoryRaider/releases) and change the reference in the project.</strong>

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the process name of the game in which you want to change the gravity value.
3. Indicate whether you know the current gravity value in the game (enter `y` or `n`).
4. If you selected `y`, enter the current gravity value.
5. Enter the new gravity value.
6. The application will change the gravity value of the specified game.
